        <h2>Team 236</h2>
        <p class='subhead'>A Hall of Fame FIRST Robotics Team</p>
        <p>
            Team 236, the Techno-Ticks, is a FIRST Robotics team from Old Lyme, CT.
            It accomodates students from both Lyme-Old Lyme and East Lyme high schools
            to provide them with the opportunity to explore their interests through
            exciting mentor-led programs focused on the production of competitive,
            high quality FRC robots.
        <br>
            From 2016 through 2018, I have been the lead programmer for team 236, writing
            nearly all of our robot code. Through robotics, I've learned a lot, not only
            about programming, but more importantly about working within a team and
            communicating with other people who didn't understand my work.
        <br>
            In 2009, after 7 consecutive years of regional Chairman's award wins, the
            Techno-Ticks were awarded the National Chairman's award at the National
            Championships. As a result, team 236 entered the Hall of Fame. Ever since,
            our membership in the Hall of Fame has a been a defining feature in the
            team's culture. Students are expected to be models of Gracious Professionalism
            and the tenets of the FIRST philosophy by helping other teams and maintaining
            high standards of sportsmanship.

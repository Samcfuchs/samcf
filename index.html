	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		I'm an aspiring computer scientist from Old Lyme, Connecticut, a small
		shoreline town at the mouth of the Connecticut River. I came to Cornell
		University in Ithaca, New York, in the summer of 2018, and since my
		arrival, I've focused on my career in Data Science while enjoying
		ultimate frisbee on the Shake.

	<h1>Robotics</h1>
	<p>
		For four years, I took on a leadership role on my highschool FIRST
		robotics team, the Techno-Ticks. As a Hall of Fame team, we had large
		shoes to fill every year. As the lead programmer, I was responsible for
		all the code that ran and controlled its movement on the field. As a team
		leader, I helped to coordinate students and oversee the design,
		prototyping, and manufacturing stages through the 6-week build season and
		assumed a continuing role in developing our strategy and incorporating
		data into our analysis process to gain a better understanding of the game.

			<h3>Recycle Rush</h3>
			<p>
				My freshman year was a formative one, as I was dropped into a wholly new
				and unfamiliar competition and had to quickly learn how to work within my
				team and learn new skills that would become crucial in the coming years. I
				began by learning the wiring systems of the robot, building a number of
				prototype electrical boards to allow testing around the shop. Soon, I
				gravitated toward the programming subteam, where Jared DiCarlo helped
				teach me to write sophisticated programs to control the robot autonomously
				and to aid driver control during the teleoperated period of the match.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, during the competition season, I worked with other students to
				scout other teams, producing data that helped our team select alliances
				and formulate match strategy. My first exposure to scouting came on the
				data-gathering side, but I quickly became interested in how our data was
				used to help the team.
			</p>

			<h3>Stronghold</h3>
			<p>
				Jared's graduation left the team with only one programmer with one year
				of experience, a situation that did not inspire great optimism among the
				students. However, with the help of a number of mentors, friends, and
				team members, I was able to step up to the challenge, programming an
				effective autonomous mode and enabling one of our most powerful and
				resilient robots to be utilized fully by Nate Bersing, one of the most
				experienced and skilled drivers our team has had. Now a driver, I worked
				closely with Nate to understand what he wanted and expected from the
				robot, and then worked to implement those expectations in the interface
				I designed for him.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having spent much of our build season teaching myself advanced robot
				control and waiting for prototyping and fabrication of the robot to
				finish, I entered the competition season still tuning many of our
				important closed-loop systems, a process that often requires weeks of
				dedicated time. Meanwhile, I worked closely with our scouting lead to
				refine our data collection to meet the needs of our strategy and
				organize our data for easier processing and application.

			<h3>Power Up</h3>
			<p>
			In 2018, I assumed a number of major leadership roles on the team.
			Throughout build season, I corresponded with the members of each subteam
			in order to gain a high-level understanding of the status of the project,
			and organized our scheduling accordingly. I had a complete understanding
			of every component of the robot-content and used this knowledge
			extensively, as I was involved in virtually every maintenance and
			debugging process throughout the season.
			</p>
			<p>
			Most important to me, however, was my role in the team's scouting and
			strategy. I introduced our team to the use of external databases, which
			allowed us to make predictions about teams that we had no scouting data
			on, and formulate strategies early on in the World Championship
			tournament, when other teams didn't know what to expect. This new
			data-driven scouting also allowed us to come to broader conclusions about
			the state of the metagame as a whole by analyzing thousands of matches
			simultaneously, giving us an unprecedented leg up on our competition.

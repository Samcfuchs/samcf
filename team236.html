            Team 236, the TechnoTicks, is a FIRST Robotics team based out of
            Lyme-Old Lyme High School in Connecticut. We're not large, nor are we
            the best team in the area, but we do our best to fulfill the goals of
            FIRST Robotics: to inspire and teach the next generation of engineers,
            inventors, and creators. As the lead programmer of the team, I feel I
            have learned this especially well.

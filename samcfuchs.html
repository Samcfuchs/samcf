            Hi, I'm Sam. I'm a sophomore in high school, and a dedicated
            programmer. I wrote my first line of code in middle school, when a
            teacher introduced me to codecademy. From the first line of
            JavaScript I wrote, I was hooked. I loved, and still love, math and
            science, and through code, I was able to experiment with that
            knowlege and bring it to life. Since then, programming has become
            more than a hobby to me.  It's become a passion, and by channeling
            that passion, I have accomplished many things.

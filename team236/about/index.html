    <h1>About Team 236</h1>
    <p>
        Team 236, the TechnoTicks, is a FIRST Robotics team based out of
        Lyme-Old Lyme High School in Connecticut. The team was founded in
        1999 by Mr. Derry and a group of dedicated students. After the team
        was established and continued to have success in the region, we moved
        forward. Thanks to community outreach and support of the Connecticut
        FLL community, among other work, the TechnoTicks won the Chairman's
        Award at the national level in 2009. Since then, the team has
        continued to promote science and technology and to improve in robot
        design. To date, the team has won 16 blue banners in its 17 years of
        competition.

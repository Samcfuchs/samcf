        <p>
            Team 236, the TechnoTicks, is a FIRST Robotics team based out of
            Lyme-Old Lyme High School in Connecticut. We're not large, nor are
            we the best team in the area, but we do our best to fulfill the
            goals of FIRST Robotics: to inspire and teach the next generation of
            engineers, inventors, and creators. As the lead programmer of the
            team, I feel I have learned this especially well.
